## ** Welcome to BE in space online**
Within the game, the user controls a spaceship. The goal is to take full control of the loaded galaxy. Other planets will attempt to stop you by sending out their most powerful forces (Enemies). As a player you will have to face them all to guarantee your continued reign.
Optionally, you can choose to play with a friend (LAN Multiplayer). Choosing this option will instantiate another spaceship. The other player should be a guest on your local IP.
All game is handling in 3D objects, including moving and rotations.
The gameâ€™s world is a sphere, which can be navigated from within. The players will not be able to escape this sphere, doing so will result in a gameover. All movements, translations and rotations are done in a 3D world space.
The enemies that try to kill you are operating on AI movement so they always follow you intelligently and in a unique way, players will destroy enemies by shooting rockets.
